The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

## Output Data Structure
#### Factor Values
* SubjectCode - identifier of the subject you carried out the experiment 
* Activity - activity performed during the measurement: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

#### Guide for interpreting each measure variable
* **X, Y, Z:** is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y, and Z directions
* leading **t**: time domain signals 
* leading **f**: frequency domain signals where the measure value was derived from a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT)
* contains **mean**: mean value 
* contains **std**: standard deviation value 
* contains **Body**: reading relates to the subject's body movement
* contains **Gravity**: reading relates to gravity
* contains **Acc**: accelerometer reading
* contains **Gyr**: gyroscopic reading
* contains **Jerk**: body jerk reading
